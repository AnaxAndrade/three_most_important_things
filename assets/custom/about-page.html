        <p>
            There is a parable of a business man in the 1920s, who approached
            a major corporation and bet them 1 million dollars that he could make
            all of their employees 30% more productive. The company took the bet,
            and the man handed out printed cards that had 3 checkboxes on them,
            told them to write down the 3 Most Important Things they needed to
            accomplish each day. Just 3. And keep it in front of them all day, and
            to check them off as they went.
